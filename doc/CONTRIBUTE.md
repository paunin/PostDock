# How to contribute to PostDock project?

Here you can see short list of actions you need to do

* Check issues on github if you want to pick one to help with
* Modify code...obviously
* Write tests. Check [the test directory](../tests/README.md) to understand how to run or create new tests
* Submit pull request and reply comments in case you care

## Developer tips

* Don't modify Dockerfile-s directly - use [make.sh](../make/make.sh) to build them from [the templates](../src/includes/dockerfile)
* Run tests before submitting a new pull request
* Check issues page on github and google before creating a new issue
